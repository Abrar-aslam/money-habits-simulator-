# 💸 Personal Finance Time Machine

A **personal finance web app** that helps users track money, build habits, and simulate their financial future in an interactive way. It is built as a **single-page application** using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** with a clear **MVC-style architecture** inspired by common JavaScript MVC patterns and modern dashboard UX practices. [web:56][web:98]

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Core Finance Tracking

- Log **income** and **expenses** with date, category, and description.
- Automatic KPIs:
  - Total income
  - Total expenses
  - Net balance
  - Savings rate

This mirrors core functionality found in many personal finance dashboards and expense trackers. [web:52][web:57]

### 2. Finance Copilot (AI-style Insights)

- Analyses your data and explains:
  - Whether your cash flow is positive or negative.
  - How strong your savings rate is (good / average / low).
  - Which category you spend the most on and where you can cut.
- Runs a simple **trend-based prediction** over recent months of expenses to:
  - Estimate next month’s expenses.
  - Generate human-readable suggestions (e.g., “trend is up, plan a buffer”).

This pattern is inspired by AI-driven personal finance products that turn raw numbers into guidance. [web:77][web:89]

### 3. Time Machine Simulator

- Interactive sliders for:
  - Projection length (months).
  - Monthly income growth %.
  - Monthly expense growth %.
- Simulates future **net worth** over time and renders an **animated line chart** so you can visually see the impact of different behaviors.
- Uses the HTML `<canvas>` API with `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation.

Using canvas-based line charts and slider-driven projections is a common technique in interactive dashboards. [web:75][web:98]

### 4. Goal Planner

- Create financial goals with:
  - Goal name (e.g., “New laptop”, “Emergency fund”).
  - Target amount.
  - Target duration in months.
- The app compares:
  - **Required monthly savings** vs **current monthly savings**.
- Classifies each goal as:
  - Comfortable
  - Tight
  - Unrealistic
- Provides suggestions such as:
  - “Trim non-essential categories.”
  - “Extend timeline or increase income.”

This is similar to goal-based planning flows in modern consumer finance apps. [web:79][web:89]

### 5. Habit & Streak System

- Built-in habits:
  - “Log today”
  - “No food delivery”
  - “Review dashboard”
- Tracks **streaks per habit** and stores:
  - Current streak length.
  - Last completed date.
- Visually marks today as done and resets streaks when a day is missed.
- Encourages consistent logging and healthier money behavior using gamification, similar to dedicated habit tracker apps. [web:91][web:101]

### 6. Export & Portability

- One-click **CSV export** of all transactions.
- CSV opens directly in:
  - Excel
  - Google Sheets
  - Other spreadsheet / BI tools
- Makes it easy to:
  - Share data with mentors or accountants.
  - Back up or migrate data.

Exporting to CSV is a standard feature in personal finance trackers and dashboard tools. [web:79][web:107]

### 7. Mobile‑First Interactive UI

- **Responsive layout** using CSS Grid and media queries:
  - Two columns on desktop (form + dashboard).
  - Stacked cards on mobile, with dashboard shown first.
- UI behaviors:
  - Card hover glows.
  - KPI hover highlights.
  - Table row hover lift.
  - AI panel soft “breathing” animation.
  - Animated net-worth chart.
- On smaller screens:
  - Layout collapses to a single column.
  - Less critical table columns are hidden for clarity.

These patterns follow best practices for mobile dashboard UX and responsive finance UIs. [web:98][web:102]

## 🏗️ Tech Stack & Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, transitions, keyframe animations)
  - Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

- **Browser APIs**
  - `localStorage` for persistence.
  - `<canvas>` 2D context for the simulator chart.
  - `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth chart animations.

These are commonly used to build interactive dashboards without large frameworks. [web:75][web:98]

### Architecture (MVC-style)

The app follows a **Model–View–Controller (MVC-like)** structure, similar to well-known vanilla JS MVC examples. [web:56][web:62]

- **Model**
  - Manages core data and business logic:
    - Transactions (income/expenses).
    - Summary calculations (income, expenses, net, savings rate).
    - Monthly aggregates (for trends and simulation).
    - Habits (streak count and last completed date).
    - Simple metadata (e.g., last summary for “what changed since last visit”).
  - Uses `localStorage`:
    - Keeps the app offline-capable.
    - Avoids backend complexity for this version.

- **View**
  - Handles all DOM interaction and rendering:
    - Transaction form.
    - KPIs and stats.
    - AI insight panel.
    - Habit streak pills.
    - Time Machine sliders and canvas drawing.
    - Transactions table.
  - Responds to model data through exposed render methods.

- **Controller**
  - Connects user actions to model updates and view refresh:
    - Form submissions.
    - Delete buttons in the transaction table.
    - Simulator slider changes.
    - Habit pill clicks.
    - “Refresh AI insights” and “Export CSV” buttons.
  - Uses a central `refresh()` to keep the UI in sync whenever transactions or habits change.

## 🧠 Analytics & “AI-style” Logic

The app uses straightforward logic to mimic AI-like behavior while staying deterministic and explainable:

1. **Summaries**
   - Aggregates all transactions to compute:
     - Total income.
     - Total expenses.
     - Net balance.
     - Savings rate (net / income).

2. **Trend-based Prediction**
   - Groups expenses by month.
   - Uses a simple **linear trend** over the last few months:
     - Calculates slope and intercept.
     - Predicts next-month expense.
   - Clamps negative predictions to zero and uses the predicted value to:
     - Generate “trend up/down” commentary.
     - Suggest creating buffers or keeping habits.

3. **AI-style Text Insights**
   - Maps numeric metrics to human-friendly sentences, for example:
     - Savings rate > 30% → “excellent”.
     - Savings rate 10–30% → “good but improvable”.
     - Savings rate < 10% → “needs attention”.
   - Identifies top spending category and suggests trimming it.
   - Shows “since last visit” changes based on stored previous summary.

4. **Habits**
   - For each habit:
     - Checks last completion date.
     - If completed today: keep streak.
     - If completed yesterday: streak++.
     - Otherwise: streak resets to 1 on new completion.
   - Reflects current streaks in the UI with simple icons and colors.

These approaches are inspired by how AI-augmented finance tools and habit trackers provide insights and gamification. [web:77][web:89][web:91]
